# Alarm Clock #

A plugin for both Sublime Text **3** that allows alarms to be set X hours / X
minutes into the future or at XX:XX time.

## Details ##

Need to be able to get your head down and bury yourself in your code without
missing that important meeting? This really simple plugin allows you to quickly
set alarms either a number of hours / minutes into the future or at a particular
time. Includes that all important snooze functionality in case you're not quite
done yet.

At present the audible beep only works on windows. Beeping for linux / mac will
be added shortly.
